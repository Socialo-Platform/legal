### 3. Duration

This agreement shall enter into force on the date of its signature and shall remain in force for as long as the contractual relationship between the parties derived from the Socialo service subscription contract lasts.

**NOTE**: The 30 calendar day period is considered reasonable for most cases. In exceptional situations requiring a longer period due to data volume, the **CONTROLLER** must request it in writing before the contract ends, and the parties shall agree in good faith on a reasonable extension.

After said period, the **PROCESSOR** shall proceed to **delete or return all personal data** to the **CONTROLLER**, as the latter indicates, and delete existing copies, unless Union or Member State law requires their retention.

The **PROCESSOR** may retain personal data **duly blocked** for a maximum period of **5 years** from the end of the agreement, exclusively to address possible legal liabilities arising from the execution of the contract (tax, civil, commercial, or administrative), in compliance with Article 32 of the LOPDGDD and Article 1.964.2 of the Spanish Civil Code.

During the blocking period, data **may not be accessed or processed** by the **PROCESSOR**, except to make it available to Courts and Tribunals, the Public Prosecutor's Office, competent Public Administrations, the Ombudsman, the Court of Auditors, or data protection authorities that require it for the exercise of their functions.

After the blocking period has elapsed without requiring retention, data will be definitively deleted through secure procedures that prevent recovery.

Communication to Data Protection Authorities. It is the CONTROLLER's responsibility to communicate security breaches to the Data Protection Authority.

#### 5.14. Support in Conducting Prior Consultations with Supervisory Authorities

The **PROCESSOR** will support the **CONTROLLER** in conducting prior consultations with the supervisory authority, when appropriate.

#### 5.15. Compliance with Obligations

The **PROCESSOR** will make available to the CONTROLLER the information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with its data protection obligations. This information may include security certifications, documentation of policies and procedures, or existing audit reports.

**Presentation of existing audit reports:**

The **CONTROLLER** accepts that the **PROCESSOR** may satisfy audit requirements by presenting recent audit reports (less than 12 months old) conducted by other clients or independent auditors, provided they cover the relevant areas of data processing. If the **CONTROLLER** considers that such reports are not sufficient for their specific needs, they may request an additional audit justifying the need.

The **CONTROLLER** may request audits with a maximum frequency of once a year, unless there is justified cause (such as a security breach, significant changes in data processing, or a requirement from a competent authority). Audits must be notified with a minimum of 30 calendar days' notice, conducted exclusively during the **PROCESSOR's** business hours (Monday to Friday, 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM), by telematic means unless physical access is strictly necessary, and may not interfere with normal business operations.

The auditor must previously sign a confidentiality agreement with the **PROCESSOR**, respect all confidential information not related to the audit, and be subject to supervision by **PROCESSOR** personnel throughout the process. Audit costs will be borne by the **CONTROLLER**, unless significant non-compliance by the **PROCESSOR** is detected.

#### 5.16. Security Measures

The PROCESSOR will apply at minimum security measures that allow:

> **a)** Ensuring the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services.
>
> **b)** Restoring the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident.
>
> **c)** Regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures implemented to ensure the security of processing.
>
> **d)** Pseudonymizing and encrypting personal data, where applicable.

#### 5.17. Data Protection Officer

The PROCESSOR will communicate the identity and contact details of the data protection officer to the **CONTROLLER**, whenever their appointment is mandatory or the **PROCESSOR** has voluntarily appointed one.

### 6. Controller Obligations

It is the responsibility of the **CONTROLLER**:

> **a)** To provide the **PROCESSOR** with the data necessary for the provision of services referred to in this agreement.
>
> **b)** To carry out, when required by regulations, an impact assessment on the protection of personal data of the processing operations to be carried out by the **PROCESSOR**.
>
> **c)** To carry out the appropriate prior consultations with Data Protection Authorities.
>
> **d)** To ensure, prior to and throughout processing, compliance with the GDPR-EU by the **PROCESSOR**.
>
> **e)** To supervise the processing of data, including carrying out inspections and audits.

### 7. Non-compliance

Non-compliance by the **PROCESSOR** with the obligations referred to in this agreement will result in them also being considered a controller, being liable before Data Protection Authorities, or any third party, for any infringements that may have been committed arising from the execution of this agreement and/or compliance with current legislation on the protection of personal data.

### 8. Liability

Both the **CONTROLLER** and the **PROCESSOR** shall be liable for all damages and losses caused to the other party in all cases of negligent or culpable conduct in the fulfillment of the obligations that respectively correspond to them, pursuant to what is agreed in this agreement.

Neither party shall assume any liability for non-performance or delay in the performance of any of the obligations under this agreement if such non-performance or delay results from or is a consequence of force majeure or fortuitous event admitted as such by Jurisprudence, provided that such event is: (i) unforeseeable, (ii) unavoidable and insurmountable, and (iii) beyond the control of the party invoking it.

The following shall be considered force majeure causes: natural disasters of extraordinary magnitude (earthquakes, catastrophic floods), war, terrorist acts, or exceptional total confinement measures adopted by government authorities that materially prevent the execution of the service.

**The following shall NOT be considered force majeure**: ordinary technical failures, power outages lasting less than 24 continuous hours, internal strikes of the **PROCESSOR**, or any circumstance that could have been avoided through the adoption of reasonable technical and organizational security measures, including the implementation of redundancy systems, backups, and business continuity plans.

In particular, the **PROCESSOR's** security, confidentiality, and security breach notification obligations will not be exempt due to force majeure causes, unless their compliance is materially impossible due to total physical destruction of facilities and backups.

### 9. Confidentiality

The **PROCESSOR** guarantees that it will maintain the strictest confidentiality and express compliance with professional secrecy regarding the **CONTROLLER's** matters during the term of service provision and after its termination.

The **PROCESSOR** during and after the term of this agreement will treat all information owned by the CONTROLLER in a strictly confidential manner, taking the necessary measures to ensure that its content is not disclosed to third parties, nor that they can have access to it without the express authorization of the **CONTROLLER**.

For the purposes of this agreement, confidential information shall mean any information capable of being disclosed by word, in writing, or by any other means or medium, tangible or intangible, currently known or to be invented in the future, whether exchanged as a result of this contractual relationship or that one party indicates or designates as confidential to the other.

### 10. Notifications

Any notification necessary for the purposes of this agreement shall be made in writing to the attention and address of who appears in the heading of this agreement.

### 11. General Provisions

**1.** This contract contains the entire agreement between the parties on the same subject and supersedes and replaces any prior agreement, verbal or written, that the parties may have reached.

Likewise, in case of contradiction between the conditions stipulated in this agreement and any other signed previously between both parties, what is stipulated in this agreement shall prevail.

**2.** Nothing stipulated in this agreement implies identity of parties, or that one is considered the agent of the other. Neither party shall be liable for any statement, act, or omission of the other party that is contrary to the foregoing.

**3.** Any modification to the content of this agreement will only be effective if made in writing and with the consent of both parties.

**4.** The failure by either party to enforce any of its rights under this agreement shall not be considered to constitute a waiver of such rights in the future.

**5.** The contractual documents are, in order of priority, this contract and its annexes. In case of contradiction, the contract shall prevail over the annexes.

### 12. Legislation and Jurisdiction

This agreement shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with Spanish law in everything not expressly regulated, with the parties submitting, for any disputes that may arise in relation thereto, to the jurisdiction of the Courts and Tribunals of Madrid, waiving any other jurisdiction that may correspond to them.

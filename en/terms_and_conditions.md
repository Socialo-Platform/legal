BY INDICATING ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT OR BY USING THE SERVICE, THE CLIENT ENTERS INTO A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT WITH SOCIALO. IF THE CLIENT DOES NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, THEY MUST NOT USE THE SERVICE.

Socialo, S.L. (hereinafter Socialo) is an online service designed to boost engagement, strengthen community, and improve internal communication in communities, organizations, educational institutions, residences, associations, and entities of various kinds. These terms set out the rights and obligations of the user and Socialo as the service provider.

Access to and use of the Service implies full and unconditional acceptance of these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree to these terms, you must not use the Service. Additionally, Socialo reserves the right to update and modify the Terms and Conditions of use without prior notice, which will always be available at www.socialo.live.

Socialo, with Tax ID B26602979 and registered office at Paseo de la Castellana, 194, Bajo B, 28046 Madrid, provides the Socialo platform and its related services (web application and iOS and Android mobile applications) in accordance with the terms set out below.

New features that may be added to the Services will be subject to the Terms of Use. If the user continues to use the Service after any modification, this will constitute their acceptance of such modifications.

Failure to comply with any of the Terms of Use may result in account cancellation.

## 1. Account Terms

To access the service, you must be at least fourteen years old. For minors under 14, consent from their parents, guardians, or legal representatives is required.

A full name, email address, and all information required by Socialo must be provided during the account creation process.

The user is responsible for providing accurate information and keeping it updated. Socialo reserves the right to delete any account if its accuracy is suspected or if it may violate any usage rules.

The user is responsible for maintaining the privacy of their account and access credentials. Socialo is not responsible for any damage or loss that may result from the user's failure to protect their access information. The user must immediately notify Socialo of any unauthorized use of their account or any other security breach.

## 2. Service Subscription

Socialo's paid plans are contracted through the platform or through the corresponding commercial proposal. The limits, features, duration, billing periods, and applicable rates are specified in the commercial conditions of each plan.

The Client is the entity that contracts and pays for access to the Service. Users are individuals authorized by the Client to use the platform.

Socialo grants the Client a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable right to access and use the Service in accordance with the applicable documentation, subject to the quotas and limits of the contracted plan during the subscription period. All rights not expressly granted to the Client are reserved by Socialo.

Socialo reserves the right to modify rates, notifying the Client at least thirty (30) days before they take effect.

## 3. Payment and Access

The Service will be charged according to the cycles and conditions established in the contracted plan. Unless otherwise specified, invoices will be due thirty (30) calendar days from their issue date.

There will be no refunds or credits for partial periods of the Service, nor will there be refunds if the Client does not use the Service during the period when the account is active, except as specified in the refund policy.

In case of non-payment by the due date, Socialo may claim late payment interest in accordance with the current legal rate, without prior notice. The Client will reimburse Socialo for all reasonable and documented costs, including attorney fees, incurred in collecting unpaid amounts. Socialo also reserves the right to temporarily suspend access to the platform after notifying the Client by email, maintaining such suspension until the non-payment is regularized.

In case of termination of the contractual relationship for any reason, including non-payment, Client data will be retained for a period of thirty (30) days to allow for download, after which it will be securely deleted in accordance with current regulations, unless there is a legal obligation to retain it.

No fee includes taxes or duties required by governmental authorities (VAT or others). The Client is responsible for paying these taxes or obligations.

The Client has the right to decide which users to add to their account and with what role, according to the platform's functionalities.

## 4. Content Management

The Client, through their management team or designated administrators, will receive administrator access to their institutional profile on Socialo and will be responsible for its initial setup and subsequent maintenance.

The Client will independently manage content, profiles, events, and communications from the beginning of the relationship. Socialo will not participate in generating or editing content.

## 5. Digital Intermediation Services

Socialo acts as a digital intermediation service provider, offering a SaaS technology platform that allows the management of content, events, profiles, and communications between the Client and end users, in accordance with Article 16 of Law 34/2002 on Information Society Services and Electronic Commerce (LSSI), and Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 on a single market for digital services (Digital Services Regulation).

The Client will be solely responsible for the content they publish, manage, or administer through the platform, including texts, images, videos, links, events, or any other information. The Client declares and warrants that:

(i) they have all the necessary rights, licenses, or authorizations for their use;
(ii) the content does not infringe third-party rights or contain unlawful, defamatory, offensive elements or content contrary to current regulations.

Socialo does not actively monitor published content but may take reasonable detection, flagging, or removal measures in cases where:

a) there is an administrative or judicial order;
b) a well-founded infringement notification is received pursuant to Art. 16.1 LSSI;
c) a serious risk to public interest, third-party integrity, or service legality is identified.

In these cases, Socialo may temporarily suspend or remove clearly unlawful content, after providing reasoned notification to the Client, except in cases of justified urgency.

Socialo provides the Client with:

a) an internal complaint management system accessible from the administrative profile, free, secure, and easy to use, in accordance with Art. 20 of the Digital Services Regulation, which will allow appealing moderation decisions;
b) a content reporting tool publicly available on the platform, through which any user or third party can report allegedly illegal, abusive content, or content contrary to the terms of service;
c) clear information about the content moderation policy, types of possible measures, applicable criteria, and Client resources.

Socialo commits to processing all complaints and reports received diligently, transparently, impartially, and within a reasonable time, documenting the reasons for its decisions and allowing internal review by the Client when appropriate.

Under no circumstances will Socialo be responsible for content generated, uploaded, or managed by the Client or by users authorized by them, nor for any damages that may arise from its publication or use, except in cases expressly provided by applicable law.

## 7. Cancellation and Termination

The Client is responsible for properly canceling their account. The account can be canceled at any time by contacting Socialo at cancelaciones@socialo.live or through the mechanisms enabled on the platform.

Cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing period. During that period, the Client will maintain full access to the platform. The subscription will automatically renew for successive periods unless the Client notifies their intention not to renew at least thirty (30) days before the start of the next period.

Either party may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other party if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and has not remedied such breach within thirty (30) days of receiving written notice.

Within a maximum of thirty (30) calendar days from the effective date of cancellation, Socialo will securely delete all data hosted on its systems related to the Client, except for data that must be retained by legal requirement, judicial order, or during applicable statute of limitations periods under current regulations.

User accounts are managed by the Client, who authorizes access through codes or manual validation. In case of user deletion or personal data removal, generated events and content may remain on the platform, disassociated from identifying data.

Socialo reserves the right to cancel an account or prevent use of the Service for those who engage in any of the following conduct:

- Total or partial non-payment of the price in the established terms and deadlines;
- Violation of obligations regarding data protection and confidentiality;
- Improper, illegal, or unauthorized use of the platform;

- Breach of any of these terms of use.

Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement: (a) all rights granted to the Client will cease; (b) the Client will stop using the Service; and (c) the Client will pay all Fees accrued before the termination date. Confidentiality, intellectual property, limitation of liability, and indemnification obligations will survive termination of the Agreement.

## 8. Intellectual Property

The Client will retain all intellectual or industrial property rights over the content, materials, images, texts, events, information, or any other data they incorporate, publish, or manage through the Socialo platform. The introduction of such content will not in any case imply the assignment of rights in favor of Socialo, unless there is an express agreement to the contrary.

Likewise, the Client declares and warrants that they have all the necessary rights, licenses, authorizations, and consents to use, upload, store, communicate, or share such content through the platform, and undertakes to hold Socialo harmless against any third-party claims arising from an infringement of intellectual property rights or any other type.

Socialo owns all intellectual and industrial property rights over the technology platform, software, internal structure, source code, architecture, designs, trademarks, databases, administration panels, user interface elements, and other elements developed or implemented for the provision of the service.

The user agrees not to copy, adapt, reproduce, distribute, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works from any component of the Service that Socialo owns, nor to allow third parties to do so.

The user also agrees not to use robots, spiders, and other automated devices or manual processes to monitor or copy any content of the Service.

The user may not use the service to transmit any virus, malware, or any type of malicious or harmful content.

To the maximum extent permitted by Spanish law, Socialo will not be liable for indirect damages, lost profits, data loss, loss of business opportunities, or consequential damages arising from the use of the Service.

## 12. Security and Privacy

By accepting these terms and conditions, the Parties also subscribe to the Data Processing Agreement available at **https://www.socialo.live/legal**, which governs the obligations regarding the protection of personal data that we have with our clients and that comply with legal obligations in this matter, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Organic Law 3/2018 on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (LOPDGDD).

The Data Processing Agreement forms an inseparable part of these terms and conditions and governs the processing of the Client's personal data by Socialo, as Data Processor, on behalf of the Client, as Data Controller. Socialo takes the privacy of its Clients seriously, therefore it commits to using the information provided by the Client in accordance with the terms contained in said Data Processing Agreement (when acting as data processor) and with the Privacy Policy (when acting as data controller).

The Parties undertake to keep reserved and confidential the existence and content of all documentation and information that is provided, transmitted, or disclosed by signing this Agreement regardless of the method, form, or medium used (hereinafter, "Confidential Information"), undertaking not to make any disclosure to third parties or public communication without the prior written authorization of the other party.

The confidentiality obligation will survive even after the termination, for any reason, of the contractual relationship between the parties without generating any type of compensation.

Breach of the confidentiality obligation assumed in this agreement will entitle either Party to claim the full amount of damages and losses that such breach may have caused.

**Data Protection Officer:** For any queries related to the processing of personal data, you can contact our DPO at dpo@socialo.live.

**Supervisory Authority:** If you believe your rights have not been properly addressed, you can file a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) at www.aepd.es.

## 13. Usage Data and Service Improvement

In order to continuously improve our services and better understand how users interact with the platform, we collect and analyze usage data on an aggregate basis. This includes metrics such as number of active users, use of specific features, participation in activities and events, and other platform usage indicators. This data is used for statistical purposes, product optimization, performance analysis, and to improve user experience.

This aggregate information does not contain or allow the identification of individuals and, therefore, is not considered personal data within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The processing of personal data is regulated in section 12 of these Terms and Conditions and in our Privacy Policy.

## 14. Communications

By creating an account with Socialo, the user may receive service-related communications, including platform notifications, important updates, and operational communications necessary for the operation of the service.

The user can manage their notification preferences at any time through their account settings on the platform.

Notifications about service cancellation, relevant technical incidents, access suspension, or modifications to the conditions will be made in writing to the registered email addresses.

- **For Socialo:** info@socialo.live or cancelaciones@socialo.live (as appropriate)
- **For the Client:** the email address of their legal representative or account administrator, registered on the platform.

Electronic communications will be considered valid and fully effective provided they allow proof of sending and receipt.

Except for payment obligations, neither party will be liable for failures or delays resulting from force majeure events as defined by Article 1105 of the Civil Code.

The relationship between the parties is that of service provider and client. Nothing in this Agreement creates an agency, partnership, or employment relationship.

Failure to exercise any right will not constitute a waiver thereof.

The Terms of Use establish a complete understanding between the user and Socialo regarding the Service and supersede any prior agreement, verbal or written, reached between the user and Socialo.

The Terms of Use will be governed by the laws of Spain. The user and Socialo agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Madrid to resolve any legal matter in relation to the Terms.
